# 30 Days of Data Science

I am an Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) graduate learning data science and AI to get a job as soon as possible.  
This repository tracks my 30-day intensive learning sprint, with daily notebooks and mini-projects focused on Python, Pandas, SQL, and basic machine learning.

---

## Goals

- Build solid foundations in Python for data analysis.
- Learn essential tools: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, and SQL.
- Implement basic machine learning models using scikit-learn.
- Create at least 1–2 complete mini-projects that are ready to show in interviews.

## Structure

> File names are examples. Update them to match your actual notebooks.

- `day01_basic_python.ipynb` – Python basics: variables, loops, functions.
- `day02_numpy.ipynb` – NumPy arrays and numerical operations.
- `day03_pandas_basic.ipynb` – Loading CSVs, selecting/filtering data with Pandas.
- `day04_cleaning_eda.ipynb` – Data cleaning and basic exploratory analysis.
- `day05_viz.ipynb` – Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- `project1_EDA.ipynb` – First mini-project: end-to-end exploratory data analysis on a real dataset.
- (More files will be added as I progress through the 30 days.)

## Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

> Update this section once your first project notebook is ready.

**Title:** Exploratory Data Analysis on \<Your Dataset Name\>  

**Problem:**  
Briefly describe the main question of the project. For example:  
- "Which product categories generate the most revenue for this e-commerce store?"  
- "How do Uber rides vary by time of day and location?"  

**Data:**  
- Source: \<Kaggle / personal dataset / public dataset link\>  
- Size and basic info: number of rows, main columns.

**Methods:**  
- Used **Pandas** for data loading, cleaning, feature creation.  
- Used **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualizations (histograms, bar plots, line plots, boxplots, correlation heatmaps).  
- Performed basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, distribution, correlations).

**Key Insights:**  
- Bullet point 3–5 important findings from your analysis.  
- Example:
  - Peak sales occur during weekends and evenings.
  - Category X has high revenue but low volume (high price products).
  - There is a strong positive correlation between feature A and target B.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn (later weeks)  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code, Git, GitHub  
- **Data:** CSV datasets from Kaggle and other public sources

## Progress Log

I am following a self-designed 30-day plan with around 4 hours of focused study per day.  
I will update this section as I move forward.

- **Day 1:** Setup Git/GitHub, Python refresh.  
- **Day 2:** NumPy practice.  
- **Day 3:** Pandas basics on a sample dataset.  
- **Day 4:** Data cleaning and EDA structure.  
- **Day 5:** Visualizations.  
- **Day 6–7:** First mini-project and README improvements.

(More days will be added as I continue.)
